# Hash-Analyzer

Hash-Analyzer is a lightweight Python tool designed to detect hash types and crack hashes using wordlists.
It is mainly focused on educational and penetration testing purposes to understand how password hashes can be analyzed and cracked.

> Uses the included `hashcrack.py` and an input file of hashes. See usage below.  
> (This README assumes `hashcrack.py` and `hashes.txt` are in the repo root.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Features
- Automatically detects hash type by length: MD5 (32), SHA1 (40), SHA256 (64).
- Tries every word from a `wordlist.txt` and reports cracked hashes.
- Saves cracked results to `cracked.txt`.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+  
- A wordlist file named `wordlist.txt` in the repository root (one candidate password per line).
